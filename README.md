**Next Improvement:**
- [ ] Model the domain models such as `ScheduledCarCollection`, `DroppedCarCollection`
- [ ] Add Inspection for the *Mechanic* domain and if the car is not qualified, we will decrease car in stock
- [ ] Add the doing contract with customer in the *Marketing* (or *Sales*) domain and if the contract is created, we will decrease car in stock
